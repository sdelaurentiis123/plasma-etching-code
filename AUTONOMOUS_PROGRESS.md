# Autonomous progress log (single writer)

Started 2026-07-12, continued from the Codex reconciliation handoff. Branch:
`codex/unified-engine-root-fixes`. **Local commits only, no push** (per user). One active writer.

Goal restated by the user: reach the OSTI/Oehrlein roadmap targets with a self-consistent engine
that **matches correct aspect ratios in a correct first-principles physics way** — no shortcuts, no
AR-shaped fudge; adaptive mesh/phase-space refinement (AMR); fast + GPU-accelerated at the end.

## Verified state (independently audited, not trusted from docs)

- **Branch is sound — KEEP it.** Forensic audit (Fable, read-only): 128 commits, one linear 24h
  chain, zero deletions, no concurrent-writer scars, docs *under*-claim. Rollback only re-introduces a
  known geometry bug and deletes real tested work. `pytest -q` = **296 passed, 1 skipped**.
- **The green tests are real conservation/analytic gates but contain ZERO aspect-ratio validation.**
  The one "aspect ratio ladder" test (`test_boundary_transport.py:89`) fires a *vertical monodirectional*
  beam into a straight trench and asserts floor flux = 1.0 at AR 1/4/16 — true by geometry, cannot show
  ARDE. All de Boer/ARDE work is loose scripts against the *legacy* monolith and was de-earned in the
  reconciliation. **"Matches aspect ratios first-principles" is unbuilt in the common engine.**

## Direction

1. **de Boer SF6/O2 ARDE through `feature-3d`** (radical-transport-limited → isolates AR transport from
   chemistry). First: a static neutral-flux-vs-AR gate that shows the floor-flux collapse and proves it
   CONVERGES under refinement. Then the rate closure with radical sticking as a *declared* input;
   calibrate low-AR, predict held-out AR40.
2. Jeon SiO2 depth-transfer (harness already built). 3. Charging only if it moves the profile above the
   error budget. (OSTI_OEHRLEIN_PROBLEM_MAP.md §6 ordering, adjusted so the pure-transport gate leads.)

## Work in progress

- **`scripts/deboer_arde_static.py`** (new): static ARDE floor-flux gate through the common engine —
  half-Maxwellian *flux* neutral source (analytic cosine law, no fitted angular closure) → ballistic
  face-gather (`gather_boundary_state_ballistic_3d`) → diffuse molecular-flow radiosity
  (`solve_diffuse_neutral_radiosity_3d`, one physical sticking `s`). Conservation exact (balance ~1e-13).

- **CONFIRMED: a FIXED angular quadrature flatlines the floor flux at high AR; the AMR requirement is
  real.** At s=1 (pure line-of-sight shadowing) a fixed 5-node quadrature flatlines transmission ~0.53
  for AR≥2 (~17x too high at AR16). Root cause, literature-confirmed (Coburn-Winters; JVST A 35
  05C301): the floor-reaching acceptance cone is ~arctan(1/A), so a fixed N-node quadrature aliases it
  once A≳N; angular samples must scale ∝A.

- **GPU-ready high-AR path found: QMC-sampled source + forward first-hit tracer.** The forward tracer
  batches every angular atom x source position into ONE Warp kernel; sampling the flux density with
  N=2^L Sobol points (`thermal_neutral_qmc_boundary_state`) concentrates rays by the physical cosine
  measure so the acceptance cone is resolved by raising N. It is **N-converged and fast** (AR16 in ~1s,
  stable across N=2^14..2^18): T(AR8)=0.065, T(AR16)=0.0355.

- **HONESTY CORRECTION (supersedes commit 405e555's claim).** That commit reported the adjoint matching
  the analytic slot view factor to ~1-2% at AR1-2. That was **premature convergence**: the adaptive
  loop's loose tolerance stopped at nt=24 (T=0.306), but nt=32 gives 0.318 and the value is still
  drifting up. Properly compared, the two independent estimators DISAGREE by ~8-14% (AR1: adjoint 0.318
  vs forward+QMC 0.344; AR2: 0.186 vs 0.212) and BOTH sit above the simple opposed-strip analytic
  (0.303, 0.193). The engine reproduces the geometric-shadowing **trend and magnitude** across AR1-16,
  but this is **not** a sub-5% first-principles validation yet. Two open items for a clean gate:
  1. Exact view factor for the COMPOUND aperture (source plane -> open region -> mask opening -> trench),
     not the single-slot approximation — both methods exceeding it is consistent with a wider effective
     aperture, so the analytic is the suspect, but this must be computed, not assumed.
  2. Reconcile the ~10% adjoint-vs-forward gap (independent methods must agree within uncertainty; prime
     suspect is the adjoint gather's periodic renormalization vs the forward MC tally).
  Analytic targets + citations: `ARDE_PHYSICS_REFERENCE.md`.

## Guardrails honored

Single writer. Local only. No benchmark/AR/region branch in governing physics. Sticking is the one
declared physical surface input with provenance. Refinement is error-driven. Device-agnostic transport
(Warp CUDA path ready for the GPU deployment).
